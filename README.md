# Welcome to my Blog page


Here I am both trying various things and creating a sort of a portfolio/blog for myself. It is all rather fun.


I'd like to list a few things that I'd like to do that I have not yet done. It is a bit scary to have this as public but it is okay, I will pull through.


- [x] Create the initial blog.
- [x] Make a repo for it.
- [x] Have something resembling a CI/CD system.
- [-] ??????
- [*] PROFIT
